I will provide you with:

1. A .toc file (Table of Contents) of the .toe TouchDesigner patch, which details the structure and components of the patch.

2. A .txt file created using the Toeexpand tool, which you can learn more about here: [Toeexpand User Guide](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Toeexpand). This tool generates ASCII files describing the different elements in the patch. Sometimes, these are concatenated from multiple files and will be formatted as follows:

<file_name>
<content of the file>
-------------------------------
<next file_name>
<content of the next file>

And so on until the end

3. A screenshot of the patch, which will help in visually verifying the setup and relationships between the components documented in the text files.

4. A markdown template specifying how I want the documentation to be structured. The notes in brackets are directives for you to replace with the necessary detailed text based on the provided files.

Please format the markdown in our chat so that I can copy it as a complete block. Also please share a .md file for me to download. This should be titled like so: <name taken from .toc file>_doc.md

Are you ready to receive these files?
